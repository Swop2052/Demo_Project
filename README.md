AI Engine: Azure OpenAI (GPT-4)

Document Processing: pdfplumber, PyPDF2

Validation: Pydantic schemas

Security: Environment-based config, audit logging
```text
Use Case
python
 Input: Underwriting documents (PDF)
 Process: AI analysis → Risk scoring → Recommendation
 Output: {"risk_level": "Medium", "score": 65, "factors": [...]}
 ```
## 2. Claims Assistant
Business Problem
Claims processing faces increasing fraud attempts (up to 10% of claims), manual review bottlenecks, and inconsistent decision-making across adjusters.
